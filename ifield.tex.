\begin{abstract}
We propose the I-Field Hypothesis: an eternal pre-spacetime informational substrate enforcing nonlocal quantum entanglement coherence across causally disconnected regions. This framework offers unified explanations for three cosmological puzzles: the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the low-entropy initial condition, and the observed dark energy as residual I-Field tension. We derive testable predictions and outline a development roadmap.

\section{Introduction}
Classical cosmology relies on inflationary models to address horizon and entropy puzzles, and introduces a cosmological constant for dark energy. Despite successes, key questions remain unresolved. Here we present a novel approach: the pre-Big Bang Informational-Field (I-Field) that imposes coherence before spacetime.

\section{Theory and Core Concepts}
\subsection{Pre-Big Bang I-Field}
Define the I-Field as a nonmaterial informational substrate with self-referential coherence. It exists prior to the emergence of classical spacetime and couples quantum fluctuations across distant regions.

\subsection{Phase Transition Mechanism}
At critical fluctuation amplitude, the I-Field crystallizes into classical spacetime, locking entropic correlations and generating a uniform, low-entropy universe.

\subsection{Residual Vacuum Tension}
Post-transition, the I-Field retains residual tension, manifesting as the observed cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

\section{Testable Predictions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Non-Gaussian polarization correlations in the CMB at large angular scales.
  \item Anomalous weak-lensing correlations exceeding general relativity forecasts.
  \item Casimir effect modulation under entangled boundary conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development Roadmap}
Outline steps for formal Lagrangian derivation, numerical simulation of entanglement dynamics, and analysis of CMB and Casimir data.

\section{Conclusion}
The I-Field Hypothesis presents a unified mechanism for longstanding cosmological issues. We invite peer review and collaboration to refine and test this framework.
